Juliette Lab CIS 376
Mandy McGinnis

The purpose of the lab was to create a phonetic generator based on input. 

What I did? 
- I created a generator based on input for both NATO Phonetic and Civilian Phonetic. 
- I called mine "Spy Network" and added to the theme with dark colors and specialized messages.
- I gave output based on the first letter of each word.

What I tried? 
- I tried to pull in the NATO and Civilian information from JSON files, but I was unsuccessful.
- So, I shifted to arrays within my JS and sorted through them based on the input.
